# Image-Captioner
This is a very simple app that is useful for quickly editing image captions one by one.

First, open the folder containing your source images, Image Captioner will then open the first image in the folder.
It automatically creates .txt file next to each image file.
You just click previous or next and edit captions.
When .txt files already exist, it will load existent content (for eg. if you used BLIP to caption your images automatically)

I wanted to make my life easier while training LoRAs or another checkpoint for Stable Diffusion, maybe someone will find this useful as well.

It is easy to compile this app for win users using PyInstaller.

Enjoy!

PS: Maybe I will make some updates later if you let me know, what you would like in the app.
